## Week 0 - Scratch - [Let's Play OSRS](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1043180671/)

Week 0 was pretty fun because we had to create a game on the scratch.mit.edu website. After learning about conditionals, loops, variables, etc., we had to go on the website and create code there to make a game or story. I decided to make a game where you're a knight, and for 30 seconds, you have to make sure you don't get hit 5 times. The game is called Let's Play OSRS. Click on Let's Play OSRS to go to the game and check it out.
