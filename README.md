## Week 0 - Scratch - [Let's Play OSRS](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1043180671/)

Week 0 was pretty fun because we had to create a game on the scratch.mit.edu website. After learning about conditionals, loops, variables, etc., we had to go on the website and create code there to make a game or story. I decided to make a game where you're a knight, and for 30 seconds, you have to make sure you don't get hit 5 times. The game is called Let's Play OSRS. Click on Let's Play OSRS to go to the game and check it out.

## Week 1 - C Programming Language

- Hello, Me

    For the first coding homework project, we had to use the terminal to make a directory with mkdir called "me," then cd into the directory, and lastly type out code hello.c to create our C file and start coding. With my background in using Linux, that was the easy and fun part. I love using Linux. The homework was to code an input that would ask, "What's your name?" and have it return "Hello, name." I was able to execute this by just using printf followed by a hello and a %s to pull the input of the user's name, so it would say back "Hello, name."

- Mario

    For the second coding homework, this was a little bit more difficult because we had to implement a program in C that recreates a pyramid that ascends right-aligned using the hash '#' text. The rules were that the program rejects inputs like -1, 0, letters, or words, and it only accepts numbers from 1 to 8. The walkthrough video was super helpful but it only gave the building blocks to build a left-aligned pyramid. The trick was to implement spaces into a prototype function called 'print_row', where the main function calls the 'print_row' function to add the spaces needed to "push" the bricks to the right, creating a right-aligned pyramid.
